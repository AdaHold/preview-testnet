## AdaHold Wiki

Though users will in most cases interact with AdaHold smart contract via [AdaHold website](https://adahold.com/), this is not mandatory. Since AdaHold is a truly decentralized token, the minting/burning of AdaHold tokens is also possible by making a valid transaction. Our [Wiki](https://github.com/AdaHold/token-preview-testnet/wiki) has detailed guide how to make the minting/burning transaction by yourself.
